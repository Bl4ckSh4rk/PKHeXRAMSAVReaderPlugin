# ram2savPlugin
[PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX) plugin to export Pokemon from old ramsav.bin files.

## How to use
Put the plugin into the plugins folder in your PKHeX directory, then access it from the Tools menu.

This plugin supports exporting Pokemon as PK6 files into a folder of your choice as well as exporting into pcdata.bin files.

Editing the ramsav.bin is not supported and never will be. Ram2sav is a deprecated method since there are ways to export/import proper 'main' save files now.

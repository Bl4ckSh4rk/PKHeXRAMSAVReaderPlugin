# PKHeX RAM2SAV Reader Plugin
[PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX) plugin to enable reading of old *ramsav.bin* files (Gen 6).

RAM2SAV has been **_deprecated_** since *2016*. *Saving* the *ramsav.bin* is **_not_** supported! Use **_Custom Firmware (CFW) / Homebrew_** to properly export and import *main* save files nowadays.

## How to use
Put the plugin into the *plugins* folder in your PKHeX directory. Create it if it doesn't exist.
If PKHeX crashes or you are unable to load your *ramsav.bin*, make sure to unblock the plugin. Left click the .dll, go to Properties and check *Unblock*.

You will then be able to load *ramsav.bin* files like regular save files.
